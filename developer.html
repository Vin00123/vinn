            <h2>Developer Profile</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Melvin Enriquez, a Grade 12 student at Sta. Lucia High School. I have a passion for web development and I'm constantly learning new technologies to enhance my skills. I believe in creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites that provide a great user experience.</p>
            <p>I've worked on various projects, from simple static websites to more complex web applications. My goal is to pursue a career in software development and make a significant impact in the tech industry. I believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems and improve people's lives.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy exploring new programming languages, working on personal projects, and staying updated with the latest trends in web development. While I am particularly interested in front-end development, I am also expanding my knowledge in backend development and databases.</p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting my page. I look forward to connecting with you and sharing more about my journey as a developer. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, please feel free to reach out to me.</p>
            <p>Stay tuned for more updates on my latest projects and achievements. I am excited to share my progress with you and continue growing as a developer.</p>
